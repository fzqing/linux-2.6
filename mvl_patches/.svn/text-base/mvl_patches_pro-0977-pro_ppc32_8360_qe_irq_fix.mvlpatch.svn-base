# Patch: -pro_ppc32_8360_qe_irq_fix
# Date: Fri Nov  3 21:35:34 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 20172
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to Shlomi Gridish <gridish@freescale.com>
# Signed-off-by: Randy Vinson <rvinson@mvista.com>
# Description:
# The UCC Ethernet driver failed to initialize a lock variable causing mutex
# warnings. Also, Freescale's QUICC Engine interrupt code was not compatible
# with threaded hard IRQs. This resulted in a call to __do_IRQ with interrupts
# enabled (the interrupt handler had hooked the interrupt using SA_INTERRUPT
# to keep interrupts disabled.) This request is not honored by the threaded
# IRQ handing. SA_NODELAY was added to cause the interrupt to run unthreaded and
# with interrupts disabled. This should not cause any problems because the
# this is a cascaded interrupt controller and the driver is just reading the
# active source from the controller in order to dispatch the correct handler.
# Locks were also added around the register read/modify/write sequences since
# they were missing in the original code.
