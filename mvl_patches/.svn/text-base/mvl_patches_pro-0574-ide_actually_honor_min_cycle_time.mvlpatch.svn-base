# Patch: -ide_actually_honor_min_cycle_time
# Date: Fri May 26 10:18:00 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 17554
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: accepted into 2.6.17-rc2-mm1
# Signed-off-by: Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
# Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
# Description:
# 
# The function ide_timing_compute() fails to *actually* take drive's
# specified minimum PIO/DMA cycle times into account -- when doing this, it
# calls ide_timing_merge() on the 'struct ide_timing' argument which contains
# garbage at the moment, and then ultimately destroys the read cycle time by
# quantizing the ide_timing[] entry, instead of copying from that entry to
# the argument structure, and only then doing a merge/quantize.
