# Type: Defect Fix

# Description:
# 
# Fixes a rounding error in the HRT version of tstojiffie() which
# would cause low-res timers to trigger fractionally early.
# 
# The problem only effects kernels with CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS
# enabled. It's common to all architecture, and product lines.
# 
# This would show up in the libposixtime test clock_nanosleeptest, and
# the failure looked like the following,
