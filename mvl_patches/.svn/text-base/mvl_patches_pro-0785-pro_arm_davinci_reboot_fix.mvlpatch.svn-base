# Date: Thu Jul  6 19:21:37 2006
# Source: Texas Instruments, Inc.
# MR: 19046
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: local
# Signed-off-by: Kevin Hilman <khilman@mvista.com>
# Description:
# This fix (from TI) fixes the following problem:
# 
# Before configuring the watchdog timer, the watchdog timer is not
# placed into a known state. In other words, if someone happened to use
# this timer as a regular timer in an application, the timer is not reset
# before it is configured. Hence, I think that we should make sure the
# timer is placed into reset before we start to configure the timer.
