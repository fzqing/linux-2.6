# MR:16447
# Summary: kjournald consuming CPU
# Source:  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112112071813765&w=2
# Type: integration
# Disposition: merged from above
# Description:
# Machines running heavy file system load were spending a rather large amount of time
# in JBD (kernel). This was due to a flat spin that was not relaxing the loop to allow
# other threads to run. This has been fixed.
