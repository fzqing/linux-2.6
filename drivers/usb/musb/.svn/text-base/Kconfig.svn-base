	  Say Y here if your system has a dual role high speed USB
	  controller based on the Mentor Graphics silicon IP.  Then
	  configure options to match your silicon and the board
	  it's being used with, including the USB peripheral role,
	  or the USB host role, or both.

	  Texas Instruments parts using this IP include DaVinci 644x,
	  OMAP 2430, OMAP 3430, and TUSB 6010.

	  If you do not know what this is, please say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the
	  module will be called "musb_hdrc".

	  Dual-Role devices can support both host and peripheral roles,
	  as well as a the special "OTG Device" role which can switch
	  between both roles as needed.

# OTG needs both roles, not just USB_MUSB_HOST.

	help
	  Say Y here if your system supports the USB host role.
	  If it has a USB "A" (rectangular), "Mini-A" (uncommon),
	  or "Mini-AB" connector, it supports the host role.
	  (With a "Mini-AB" connector, you should enable USB OTG.)

	  connector, it supports the peripheral role.

	help
	   The most notable feature of USB OTG is support for a
	   "Dual-Role" device, which can act as either a device
	   or a host.  The initial role choice can be changed
	   later, when two dual-role devices talk to each other.

	   At this writing, the OTG support in this driver is incomplete,
	   omitting the mandatory HNP or SRP protocols.  However, some
	   of the cable based role switching works.  (That is, grounding
	   the ID pin switches the controller to host mode, while leaving
	   it floating leaves it in peripheral mode.)

	   Select this if your system has a Mini-AB connector, or
	   to simplify certain kinds of configuration.

	   To implement your OTG Targeted Peripherals List (TPL), enable
	   USB_OTG_WHITELIST and update "drivers/usb/core/otg_whitelist.h"
	   to match your requirements.
